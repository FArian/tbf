# Test-based Falsification (TBF)

To run TBF, run
`./run_iuv -i TEST_GENERATOR [--execution|--validators cpachecker --witness_validators] FILE`
form the repositories root directory
The name "iuv" stand for input-using verifier,
which is the final goal of this
tool.
Currently, only falsification using test case generators
is possible, neither 'test-based falsification' is a more
concise name for the current tool.
